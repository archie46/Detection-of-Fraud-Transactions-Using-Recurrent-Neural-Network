# Detection-of-Fraud-Transactions-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Network

This repository contains the implementation of a fraud transaction detection model based on the research paper "Detection of Fraud Transactions Using Recurrent Neural Network during COVID-19" by Samir Bandyopadhyay. The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed RNN-based approach for fraud detection during the COVID-19 pandemic.
