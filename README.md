# Detection-of-Fraud-Transactions-Using-Recurrent-Neural-Network

The report aims to detect suspicious activities of money transactions.
A classifier model associates input data into output classes after
learning from training data.
A stacked RNN-based model is proposed as a classifier model that
identifies transactions that may have deceptive issues. Multiple RNN
layers are stacked into a single platform for obtaining the proposed
model
